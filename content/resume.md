I've been working in the tech industry professionally for more than  a decade and have worn multiple hats while doing so. I've helped co-found startups, served as a CTO at one, assembled and lead some great engineering teams, worked big corps and participated in and maintained a number of open-source projects including OpenCensus and OpenTelemetry among other things.

I joined the infrastructure team in 2024 to build an internal cloud platform for Splunk's Observability Cloud products to self-service internal cloud platform and bring Software Engineering ethos to the infrastructure team. Also completed the biggest infrastructure project to enable end to end encryption and authentication across thousands of services with service mesh tech (istio). This project has a lot of challenges and was attempted twice in the last 3 years. It took me little over a year to complete and ship to production. This was a crucial project to unblock FedRAMP and other compliance issues. I also helped the team achieve a number of securirty and data compliance milestones.

In 2025, I moved back to a proper Software Engineer role working on agents such as the OpenTelemetry Collector, AppDynamics Agents, etc.
