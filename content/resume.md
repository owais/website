# Owais Lone

I've been working in the tech industry professionally for more than ten years and have worn multiple hats while doing so. I've helped co-found startups, served as a CTO at one, assembled and lead some great engineering teams, worked big corps and participated in and maintained a number of open-source projects including OpenCensus and OpenTelemetry among other things.
